Quickly find lines that match a string or regular expression.

To filter your file to lines that contain a string or match a regex:

  Edit > Line > Filter With Regex  (cmd + K  cmd + R)
  Edit > Line > Filter OUT With Regex  (cmd + K  cmd + V)
  Edit > Line > Filter With String  (cmd + K  cmd + S)

To fold your file to lines that contain a string or match a regex:

  Edit > Code Folding > Fold With Regex
  Edit > Code Folding > Fold With String

On Windows and Linux, use the ctrl key instead of the cmd key.
